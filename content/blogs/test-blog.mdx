# welcome

in this tutorial we will learn how to make a guess the number game using python
in order to make this game we need

-   python >= 3.6
-   an code editor

## step 1

first we need to import the random module

```python
import random
```

## step 2

then we need to make a variable that will store the random number

```python
random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
```

## step 3

then we need to make a variable that will store the number of guesses

```python
guessed_number = input("enter a guess: ", end="")
```

## step 4

then we need to make a while loop that will run until the user guesses the number

```python
win = False
chances = 10

while win is False and chances > 0:
    guessed_number = input("enter a guess: ", end="")
    if guessed_number == random_number:
        print("you win")
        win = True
    elif guessed_number > random_number:
        print("too high")
        chances -= 1
    elif guessed_number < random_number:
        print("too low")
        chances -= 1
```

## check if it works

we have finally made a guess the number game using python
